ToDo List

=== Needs to be done next ===
- Re-import and connect, try to get the server running after refactoring

- Config sections are stored my the hook's class name.
    - Listener.AutoOp and Action.AutoOp and Module.AutoOp should all map to the [AutoOp] config section

- Shelve DB's should be keyed the same way? But have a different file in data/ for each 'key'
    - Listener.AutoOp stores in data/AutoOp.db, etc.

- Create and import to version control


=== Modules and beyond? ===
- Model users so we can start to build fun databases against ourselves
    - Do we have to write users less as a module? 
       or
    - Do we want to let modules 'depend' on each other, and do cool module dependancy tricks?
        - I.e., CoolModule requires FacebookConnect module. Say, if the CoolModule needs to reference the user database that FacebookConnect is in charge of managing.
